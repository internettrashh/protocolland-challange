-- Title: AO Environment Setup
-- Description: Start the AOS process and get ready to write your first contract.

-- Step 1: Launch AOS.
-- Open your terminal and run the command: aos
-- This starts your personal AO process (ensure you have AO installed as per docs).

-- Step 2: After a moment, you should see the AOS welcome ASCII art and a prompt.
-- The prompt might look like:  default@aos-0.2.2[Inbox:0]> 
-- This is an interactive Lua shell connected to the AO network ([Get started in 5 minutes | Cookbook](https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/welcome/getting-started.html#:~:text=Welcome%20to%20your%20new%20home,the%20rest%20of%20this%20tutorial)).

-- Step 3: Open the editor to write a contract.
-- At the AOS prompt, type: .editor  and press Enter.
-- This opens an inline text editor where you can write multi-line Lua code for your contract.
